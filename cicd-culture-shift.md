# CI/CD - It's a culture shift

Are you looking to improve your team's development workflow, deploy faster, and feel better about the code you deploy? CI/CD are the magical letters that can help you do just that. However, implementing Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery is no easy feat. The easy part is adopting new technology, the hard… embracing a MAJOR culture shift.

In this talk, we will first define CI/CD and the operating principles that drive it. Then, we will shift to focus on the mindset it takes to truly be successful in its implementation. This can be a slow and tough transition, so I will share my learnings from leading this effort within my organization. After this talk, you will have a clear understanding of CI/CD and the buy in required from your team to be successful.

With all the advancements in the tooling around CI and CD, implementing the technology has never been easier. Helping your team embrace the cultural change necessary to follow this cycle… that’s another story.

In this talk, you’ll learn the true meaning of CI/CD — that’s Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment, if you don’t speak alphabet soup — and the various principles that drive it. To embrace these principles, you’ll need to change your team’s mindset, which can be a tough transition. I lead this transition in my organization, and I will walk you through the lessons I learned. After this talk, you will have a clear understanding of CI/CD as well as how to implement a true cultural shift in your team to take full advantage of this new, powerful methodology.

NOTES

I have driven CI/CD adoption at work over the last couple of years, and have realized how incredibly tough the cultural transition can be. You really have to have the right people buy in to be successful. I would love to share the things I've learned along the way for others who are getting started or thinking about adopting better Dev Ops practices.
