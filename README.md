# Conference-Talks

I decided to copy [Ali Spittel's idea](https://github.com/aspittel/cfps) of putting CFPs into a Github Repo. So, here's a list of conference talks that I am currently submitting, have submitted in the past, or planning to submit in the future!

- [Learn Build Teach](./learn-build-teach.md)
- [Microservices - The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly](./microservices-good-bad-ugly.md)
- [Why You Should Embrace Your Inner Millenial](./inner-millenial.md)
- [CI/CD - It's a Culture Shift](./cicd-culture-shift.md)
- [Defense Against the JavaScript Dark Arts](defense-js-dark-arts.md)
